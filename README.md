# COMP2140-Project

# PROJECT OVERVIEW

Students are required to form groups of up to 6 persons (no less than 4) and engineer a software product. The
software is to be a customized (bespoke) product that is to be developed for a real-world need/problem related
to a client (Company, club, school etc.) who is NOT part of the group. It is important that an independent client is
established to ensure the requirements engineering process can be properly done; this will be interrogated during
the software studio sessions. The implementation of the specified system must include at least 80% of the
functionality specified in the requirements. Groups may use any suitable programming language; however,
solutions must demonstrate the principles of object-oriented/procedural design, and the architecture/design
specified must be actualized in the implementation.(:)
